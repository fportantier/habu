Habu Hacking Toolkit
====================

I'm developing Habu to teach (and learn) some concepts about Python and
Network Hacking.

Some techniques implemented in the current version are:

* ARP Poisoning and Sniffing
* DHCP Discover and Starvation
* Subdomains Identification
* Certificate Cloning
* TCP Analysis (ISN, Flags)
* Username check on social networks
* Web Techonologies Identification
* and a lot more!

The development of this software is supported by Securetia SRL (https://www.securetia.com/)

point to the correct path of the Python executable.


Get Help
--------

All the commands implement the option '--help', that shows the help,
arguments, options, and default values.


Verbose Mode
------------

Almost all commands implement the verbose mode with the '-v' option.
This can give you some extra info about what habu is doing.
